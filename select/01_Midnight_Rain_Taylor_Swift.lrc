[00:00.13] Rain, he wanted it comfortable
[00:02.50] I wanted that pain
[00:04.43] He wanted a bride
[00:05.70] I was making my own name
[00:07.92] Chasing that fame
[00:09.63] He stayed the same
[00:11.34] All of me changed like midnight
[00:26.84] 
[00:28.04] My town was a wasteland
[00:30.91] Full of cages, full of fences
[00:32.86] Pageant queens and big pretenders
[00:35.79] But for some, it was paradise
[00:50.29] 
[00:41.86] My boy was a montage
[00:44.79] A slow-motion, love potion
[00:46.37] Jumping off things in the ocean
[00:48.15] I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
[01:06.15] 
[00:52.38] He was sunshine, I was midnight rain
[00:55.84] He wanted it comfortable
[00:57.32] I wanted that pain
[00:58.92] He wanted a bride
[01:00.68] I was making my own name
[01:02.77] Chasing that fame
[01:04.34] He stayed the same
[01:06.06] All of me changed like midnight
[01:21.56] 
[01:09.25] It came like a postcard
[01:12.14] Picture perfect, shiny family
[01:13.90] Holiday, peppermint candy
[01:16.96] But for him it's every day
[01:29.96] 
[01:22.41] So I peered through a window
[01:25.67] A deep portal, time travel
[01:27.43] All the love we unravel
[01:30.58] And the life I gave away
[01:42.58] 
[01:33.41] 'Cause he was sunshine
[01:34.74] I was midnight rain
[01:36.82] He wanted it comfortable
[01:38.21] I wanted that pain
[01:40.36] He wanted a bride
[01:41.86] I was making my own name
[01:43.65] Chasing that fame
[01:45.51] He stayed the same
[01:47.47] All of me changed
[01:48.42] Like midnight
[01:54.92] 
[01:49.89] Rain, he wanted it comfortable
[01:52.33] I wanted that pain
[01:54.22] He wanted a bride
[01:55.57] I was making my own name
[01:57.69] Chasing that fame
[01:59.20] He stayed the same
[02:01.01] All of me changed
[02:02.32] Like midnight
[02:08.82] 
[02:03.42] I guess sometimes we all get
[02:06.30] Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
[02:10.19] And he never thinks of me
[02:13.17] Except when I'm on TV
[02:23.67] 
[02:17.26] I guess sometimes we all get
[02:19.94] Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
[02:23.91] And I never think of him
[02:27.07] Except on midnights like this (midnights like this)
